# EnhancedWidgets
More complex tkinter widgets, with more advanced functionality for specific uses.

Originally written as part of the ([Othala](https://github.com/SPRBiosensors/Othala)) package for single molecule Raman Spectra preprocessing, I have duplicated it here to be able to use the widgets on their own in other projects.  I may or may not update them or add to their functionnality from time to time.  Feel free to use them as well :)
